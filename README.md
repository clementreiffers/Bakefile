# Bakefile

Better Makefile written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## Introduction

Welcome to Bakefile! This project is a modern reimagining of the traditional Makefile, written in Rust. Bakefile aims to address the limitations of Makefile by providing enhanced functionality, such as managing real hosted templates and incorporating built-in functions to create smaller and faster build configurations.

## Why Bakefile?

Makefiles have been the go-to solution for managing build processes in numerous projects. However, as projects grow in complexity, traditional Makefiles can become cumbersome and difficult to maintain. Bakefile seeks to overcome these challenges by introducing a more robust and feature-rich alternative, leveraging the power and performance of Rust.
